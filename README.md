You surely are going to win one this time.
All you have to do is amking four valid pull requests between 1st -31st October.
Open source has attained a sense of the untouchable too. Most of us use something that’s open sourced, but personally I’ve always seen it as something other people contribute to. Smarter people, or more experienced people, or just people with oodles of time on their hands. But that’s not the case – you too can be a contributor!

If you’re brand new to the GitHub scene, here’s the general flow:

Someone has an idea. They create a project to solve a problem, and share it with the world.
They need help. Feature requests and bug reports roll in. Issues are opened.
You can help! Anyone can offer to help out, but wouldn’t it be nice to know where help was needed most…
Pick a tag, any tag. Owners tag issues with short phrases like easy, beginner, up for grabs or even hacktoberfest, to indicate which ones might be a good starting point for someone new to the project or to open source in general.
It doesn’t have to be some grandiose, world-changing pull request either! Actually, smaller is better, and much easier for the owner to review and maintain. After all, when the dust settles and your PR is (hopefully!) accepted, the owner has to maintain it from then on.

Last year I came across a request from someone for whom English wasn’t his first language. He had extensive documentation but was asking for someone to review it. I stepped in, reviewed a dozen pages and made my first PR. It was mostly grammar fixes, and he accepted it and seemed genuinely appreciative.
